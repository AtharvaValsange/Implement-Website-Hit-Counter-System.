# Implement-Website-Hit-Counter-System.
Implementing a website hit counter system in Java involves creating a tapestry of data structures to ensure each visit is tracked accurately, transcending the intricacies of device diversity. This verdant journey through code intertwines customer and device information to ensure each unique visit is counted precisely once, reimagined to avoid redundancy. given implmentation is a captivating Java implementation of the required APIs.
Explanation About Code:
1. Data Structures:
â€¢ `customerWebsiteVisits: A mosaic of maps, where the outer map's keys are customerId', and the values are another map. The inner map's keys are 'websiteId", and the values are sets of `deviceId". This labyrinthine structure ensures that each device visit is counted once for each customer-website pair.
websiteVisits: A map where keys are 'websiteId and values are the count of unique customer visits. This crucible of data keeps track of the overall hits for each website.
2. Methods:
Visitwebsite(String customerId, String deviceId, String websiteId): This method orchestrates the process of tracking a visit. It checks if the device is already recorded for the customer-website pair and updates the overall count if the visit is new.
GetWebsiteVisitCountForCustomer(String customerId, String websiteId): Delve into this method to retrieve the number of unique devices a customer has used to visit a particular website.
GetOverallwebsiteHitCount(String websiteId): This method retrieves the total number of unique visits to a specific website, bec ing the culmination of our tracking efforts.
By weaving these intricate and enigmatic elements together, this Java implementation certainly ensures an accurate and efficient way to track website visits, captivating the essence of user interactions across a kaleidoscopic range of devices.
